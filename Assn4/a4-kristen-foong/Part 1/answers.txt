The AEP file is smaller than the PNG file.

The PNG file size is calculated by taking the amount of pixels and multiplying it by the bit depth.
In addition, the PNG file uses a lossless algorithm, meaning that it does not lose any data and only makes the file size slightly smaller.

However, for the AEP file, it does not need to encode this information.

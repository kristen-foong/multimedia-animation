The best format to save this in is the JPEG format. JPEG is better suited to compressiong photographs or images that do not have hard lines, sharp contrasts, or illustrations.
JPEG works better with realistic images and photographs. GIFs support animation but have a lesser quality, and PNGs are more suited towards text-heavy graphics, drawings, or images that have fewer colors.
